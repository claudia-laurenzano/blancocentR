Description: A package for Blanco Center staff to facilitate a cohesive
    look across data visualizations and tbales. This package includes
    ggplot2 themes, a theme for gt tables, colors and color palettes, two
    data files on Louisiana's 64 parishes and region designations by
    different agencies and organizations (one with and one without
    geometry), and a function to join parish polygons into region
    polygons. Some palettes were built using the 'monochromeR' package
    which provides methods for blending colors. Shapefiles and population
    data from the U.S. Census were acquired via the 'tidycensus' package.
