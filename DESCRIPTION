Description: A package for Blanco Center staff to facilitate a cohesive
    look across data visualizations. This package includes ggplot2 theme,
    colors and color palettes, two data files on Louisiana's 64 parishes
    and region designations by different agencies and organizations (one
    with and one without geometry), and a function to join parish polygons
    into region polygons. Some palettes were built using the 'monochromeR'
    package which provides methods for blending colors. Shapefiles and
    population data from the U.S. Census were acquired via the
    'tidycensus' package.
